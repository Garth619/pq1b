        <!-- single-case-result-title -->

        <p>Evan Borges won a Ninth Circuit appeal for former ad agency executive Thomas Rubin against the Internal
          Revenue Service. Borges successfully argued that Rubin is entitled to pursue a $10 million tax refund because
          he had complied with a legal requirement to report inconsistencies between his personal tax return and his
          company’s tax return. The Ninth Circuit reversed the district court’s dismissal of Rubin’s lawsuit against the
          IRS for denying him the tax refund. Rubin’s tax refund litigation, which the court allowed to proceed, arose
          out of changes in law related to a bankruptcy trustee’s treatment on the corporate return of a claimed $67
          million of cancellation of indebtedness income.</p>
